                    <p>I think the single most used way to start a React app is using It‚Äôs very convenient.</p>
                    <p>One problem you might stumble upon is how to connect it to a backend you already have, or one you
                        might want to create.</p>

                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <p>When developing the app you want to take advantage of hot reloading and all the other convenient
                        features of create-react-app. How can you combine that with a backend without having to use CORS
                        on the server and worry about ports?</p>

                        I am going to provide an example using Express in the post, but this applies to any other
                        framework.</p>
